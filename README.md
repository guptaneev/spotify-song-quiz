Music Quiz utilizing the Spotify Web API.

Users can add songs to be quizzed by searching song names. These song names are searched on Spotify and the song name and artist are presented for the user to add to the list of songs. The user will then be quizzed on the songs, asking for the artist's name. Finally, they receive a score at the end.
